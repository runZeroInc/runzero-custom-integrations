# runZero Custom Integrations

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the runZero Custom Integration library!

runZero is a total attack surface and exposure management platform that combines [active scanning](https://help.runzero.com/docs/discovering-assets/), [passive discovery](https://help.runzero.com/docs/traffic-sampling/), and API integrations to deliver complete visibility into managed and unmanaged assets across IT, OT, IoT, cloud, mobile, and remote environments. runZero can be used as a hosted service (SaaS) or managed on-premise. The runZero stack consists of one more Consoles, linked Explorers that run as light-weight services on network points-of-presence, and a command-line tool that can be used for offline data collection. runZero can be managed through the web interface, via API, or for self-hosted customers, on the command line.

If you are not a runZero user today, [sign up](https://www.runzero.com/try) for a trial that can be converted to our free Community Edition.

This repository includes **custom integrations** that run in the context of a runZero Explorer. These integrations are written in Starlark, a language similar to Python.

To create a custom integration within runZero, you will need a user account with `superuser` privileges.

You can find detailed documentation about Starlark-based integrations on the [runZero help portal](https://help.runzero.com/docs/custom-integration-scripts/).
