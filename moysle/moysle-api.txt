First Steps - How to make a Request using the API 
To use the Mosyle API you need to enable this feature in the API profile page (My School > API Integration > enable the profile). 
Once enabled you will see your access token and make requests to the endpoint" 
", every request will have some required 
parameters as well as optional parameters. The Mosyle API supports the POST request method. All API responses are structured in JSON format. 
If your current API integration is using Basic Authentication, please create a new API Token to use JWT Authentication as Basic Authentication has been deprecated. 
JWT Authentication 
First, make a request to the Mosyle API endpoint "/login" including the access token, email, and password in the body of the request. 
Example request: 
1 curl --include --location 'https://managerapi.moayle.com/v2/login 
2 --header Content-Type: application/json 
3-data-raw 
4 
accessToken": Access Token 
5 
"email": "User Email", 
6 
"password": "User Password" 
7}'
