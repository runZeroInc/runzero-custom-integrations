## Steps

### Digital Ocean configuration

   - Ensure the token has the required permissions to access droplets and associated metadata.

3. Test your API token by making a sample request using a tool like `curl` or Postman to verify access.

### runZero configuration

1. (OPTIONAL) - Make any necessary changes to the script to align with your environment.
    - Modify API calls as needed to filter assets.
    - Modify datapoints uploaded to runZero as needed.
2. [Create the Credential for the Custom Integration](https://console.runzero.com/credentials).
    - Select the type `Custom Integration Script Secrets`.
    - Use the `access_secret` field for your Digital Ocean API token.
    - For `access_key`, input a placeholder value like `foo` (unused in this integration).
3. [Create the Custom Integration](https://console.runzero.com/custom-integrations/new).

    - Toggle `Enable custom integration script` to input the finalized script.
    - Click `Validate` to ensure it has valid syntax.
    - Click `Save` to create the Custom Integration.
